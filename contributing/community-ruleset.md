# Community Ruleset

So you've built a new detection and you think other people might find it useful? We'd love to see it!

Currently, the best way to let the community know about it is via the project's [discussion forum](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).

In the future, we plan on promoting rules that have met a minimum bar and are expected to be generally useful in production settings (e.g. active maintenance, high quality test suite, etc). These rules will be used to verify engine compatibility for new releases.
