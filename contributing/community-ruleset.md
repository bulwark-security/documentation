# Community Ruleset

So you've built a new detection and you think other people might find it useful? The [Bulwark Community Ruleset](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark-community-ruleset) project is a good place to share it.

Plugins accepted into the Community Ruleset project are expected to be open source, meet a minimum quality bar, and to be generally useful in production settings (e.g. active maintenance, working test suite, etc). Maintainers are happy to work with you to meet this criteria during PR review. These plugins will also be used to verify engine compatibility for new releases.
