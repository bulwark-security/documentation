# Filing Bugs

Bulwark uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark/issues) to track bugs. Please include as much detail as possible in your issue to help reproduce any issue you've encountered. The issues tracker shouldn't be used to ask questions, those are better handled in the [Q\&A](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark/discussions/categories/q-a) section of the [discussion forum](https://github.com/bulwark-security/bulwark/discussions).
